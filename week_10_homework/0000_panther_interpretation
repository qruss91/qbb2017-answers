It seems that the genes which have a lower ratio in the differetial expression text might play a role in differentiation. Signaling molecules and receptors like Kalrn and Abhd tened to have lower values like this. After a bit of quick wikipedia research, it would seem this tends to be the case. (e.g. Kalrn is involved in nerve cell differentiation)
